# Image Classification with Threading and OpenCV

## Overview
This project performs image classification using deep learning techniques, threading for performance optimization, and OpenCV for image processing. It employs a single reference image to classify test images based on similarity.

## Key Features
- **Image Classification**: Utilizes deep learning models to classify images into predefined categories or labels.
- **Threading for Performance**: Implements threading to parallelize image processing tasks, improving performance.
- **OpenCV Image Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV for image manipulation, feature extraction, and similarity comparison.
- **Single Reference Image**: Compares test images against a single reference image to determine similarity and classification.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-classification.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Download Pre-trained Models**:
   Download pre-trained deep learning models for image classification (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Provide Reference Image**: Input a single reference image to use as a baseline for comparison.
2. **Upload Test Images**: Upload images to be classified into predefined categories or labels.
3. **View Classification Results**: The system will classify each test image based on its similarity to the reference image.
4. **Analyze Results**: Review the classification results and examine the similarity scores for each test image.

## Dataset
The project may utilize a dataset containing labeled images for training and testing purposes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Threading
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Deep Learning Framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
